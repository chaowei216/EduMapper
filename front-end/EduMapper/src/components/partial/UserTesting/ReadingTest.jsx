            A. The underwater world holds many challenges. The most basic of
            these is movement. The density of water makes it difficult for
            animals to move. Forward movement is a complex interaction of
            underwater forces. Additionally, water itself has movement. Strong
            currents carry incredible power that can easily sweep creatures
            away. The challenges to aquatic movement result in a variety of
            swimming methods, used by a wide range of animals. The result is a
            dazzling underwater ballet.
